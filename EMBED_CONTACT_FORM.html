  =============================================================================
  GENERAL INQUIRY FORM — For Hostinger / any website
  =============================================================================

  The iframe below often shows a "broken" or blank box if:
  - YOUR_APP_URL was not replaced with a real URL, or
  - Your Aurora Sonnet app is not deployed yet (e.g. only runs on your computer).

  RECOMMENDED: Use the STANDALONE form instead (no iframe).
  Open this file in the same folder: EMBED_CONTACT_FORM_STANDALONE.html
  It’s a plain HTML form that posts to your API and works as soon as the API
  is deployed at a public URL.

  If you do use the iframe:
  1. Deploy your Aurora Sonnet app so it’s reachable at a public URL
     (e.g. Hostinger VPS, Render, Railway, or your domain).
  2. Replace YOUR_APP_URL below with that URL (no trailing slash).
  3. Example: https://aurora.yourdomain.com
